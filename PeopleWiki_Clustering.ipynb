    "The Euclidean distance histogram shows a noticeable bias toward shorter documents among Barack Obama’s 100 nearest neighbors. This occurs because Euclidean distance is sensitive to vector magnitude, which tends to be smaller for shorter documents, leading to the clustering of lower-length texts that share overlapping terms with Obama’s article. As a result, the Euclidean approach often highlights documents that are similar in structure but not necessarily in content depth or complexity."

The bias towards short articles is not appropriate in this application as there is really no reason to  favor short articles over long articles (they are all Wikipedia articles, after all). Many of the Wikipedia articles are 300 words or more, and both Obama and Biden are over 300 words long.\n",
