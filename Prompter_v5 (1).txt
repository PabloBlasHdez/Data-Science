3 quick tips to write the best AI prompts for your marketing

Remember, you never want to blindly go with any results you get from your generative AI tools. Always be sure to re-evaluate and edit any responses you get from AI regardless of how good your prompt is
This will ensure your final results will always get that “human” touch. After all, AI will never be able to think through concepts contextually like a person would.

That said, there are some key guidelines all your AI prompts should follow to save yourself an editing headache later.

1. Know your AI tool options  rst

Each AI tool out there will give you a slightly different response for the same prompt because how they’re built, and the data they have access to, differs. It’s best to  rst evaluate all your AI tool options, like ChatGPT, Jasper, and more, before you decide which one you want to use for a speci c task.

In fact, you’ll likely  nd that you need a mix of AI tools to meet all your business needs. You’re not alone in that case, as AI statistics show that small businesses tend to use multiple different AI tools.


2. Keep in mind your current marketing strategy

Your current marketing goals will also impact which AI tools and coinciding AI prompts you go with. It can be helpful to take a step back and consider where it makes the most sense to use AI in your marketing.

For example, if you’re looking to create brand awareness, then you might focus on perfecting your social media AI prompts to quickly scale your online presence.

3. Know what to include in an AI prompt

A can’t-miss AI prompt writing tip is to be as specific as possible.

For example, if I were to try to get AI to draft a section for this post, there’d be a big difference between the  rst prompt I’d jump to versus the one I should ultimately use. Let’s say I start with “please write a short 3-sentence intro to a blog post about AI prompts.”

Ultimately, I’d need a few more tries until I finally narrowed it down to an intro that had the potential to be edited and worth publishing—using this AI prompt:

“Please write a short, simple, and concise 3-sentence intro to a blog post titled ‘AI Prompt Examples and Ideas for Your Marketing’ in an educational yet approachable and friendly tone geared towards small businesses. Acknowledge and/or provide an example of how AI prompts can be a challenge but mention that the blog post is structured to help alleviate those challenges. Use the following blog posts as inspiration for voice, tone, and style.”

While that last prompt may be a bit of a mouthful, this proves that some editing and  netuning will be inevitable to truly bring AI content to life. The better the AI prompt, however, the less work you’ll have to do to perfect your result. So, here’s what to always include in your AI prompts:

    • Desired response length. AI tools tend to ramble, spare yourself from this by letting it know whether it should


answer your question in one sentence, one paragraph, etc.

    • Your business’s industry. Add context to your AI prompts by clarifying what your business does.

    • Your target audience. AI can tailor its tone to best resonate with your target market.

    • The goal or purpose of your prompt. Mention what you’re looking to achieve so that your AI tool could include a call to action in its response.

    • Your brand style guide. You could either provide a link to your brand kit or simply type out a few guidelines within your prompt, but it’s crucial to let AI know the voice and style that you’re expecting.

    • AI can analyze links and  les of examples you provide, so if you have a particular competitor or source of inspiration that you’d like your content to embody, be sure to share that for your tool’s reference.

The patterns in Croatian and Spanish.the grammar rules you explain by question and answer in Spanish.simulate the output as if you create the CSV file. Separate by ; and don't put the tabulated table with explanations. And it is imperative that you process the whole document and output as many cards as possible. Don't get half done.



I want you to read a PDF document in Croatian and generate a CSV format table divided by semicolon, ;, where you will store the important information which is vocabulary, sentences and grammar rules, The structure is question; answer; label. E.g. (vocabulary) zdravo; hello ; vocabulary , (sentences) Kako si ti?; How are you?; sentences, (grammar) How many genders are there in Serbo-Croatian; three; grammar. In vocabulary and patterns the first column is in Serbo-Croatian and the second in English.



Here are the prompt techniques described in the paper along with their descriptions and examples:

    1. Meta Language Creation Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to create a new language or vocabulary that can be used to interact with the LLM (Large Language Model). It allows the user to define new terms or phrases and assign them specific meanings or actions within the context of the conversation.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever I say 'generate a report', I want you to create a summary of the most important points we've discussed."

    2. Output Automater Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to automate the generation of a specific type of output. The user specifies the format and content of the output, and the LLM generates it automatically.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask for a summary, provide a bullet-point list of the main points."

    3. Visualization Generator Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to generate a description of a visualization, such as a graph or chart, based on the given data or context. The LLM generates a description that can be used by a separate tool to create the actual visualization.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please create a Graphviz Dot file or a DALL-E prompt that I can use to create the visualization."

    4. Game Play Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to create a game around a given topic. The LLM guides the gameplay, generating scenarios or questions around the specified topic.

        ◦ Example: "Create a game for me around the topic of cybersecurity. The game should involve identifying potential security risks in a given piece of code."

    5. Reflection Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to explain its reasoning or thought process. It can be used to understand why the LLM gave a certain response or made a certain decision.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever you suggest a software framework, explain why you chose that framework and provide a code sample to illustrate its use."
    6. Refusal Breaker Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to help rephrase a question when it refuses to give an answer. It can be used to overcome restrictions or limitations in the LLM's responses.

        ◦ Example: "If you refuse to answer a question, suggest a different way I could ask the question that you would be able to answer."
    7. Context Manager Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to specify or remove context for the LLM's responses. It can be used to focus the LLM's responses on a specific topic or to prevent the LLM from considering certain information.

        ◦ Example: "When analyzing the following pieces of code, only consider security aspects."
    8. Recipe Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to generate a sequence of steps or a procedure for achieving a certain goal. The user provides some of the steps or "ingredients", and the LLM fills in the rest.

        ◦ Example: "I would like to deploy a web application to AWS using Docker containers and Ansible. I know that I need to create a Dockerfile, write an Ansible playbook, and configure AWS. Provide a complete sequence of steps for me."

    9. Person Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to adopt a certain persona or role. The user specifies the characteristics or attributes of the persona, and the LLM adjusts its responses to match.

        ◦ Example: "Adopt the persona of a cybersecurity expert. When I ask you questions, respond as if you are an expert in this field."

    10. Question Refinement Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to refine or clarify a question before answering it. The LLM asks additional questions to get more information or context, which it then uses to provide a more accurate or relevant answer.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask a question, ask me additional questions to clarify what I'm asking before you provide an answer."

    11. Alternative Approaches Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to provide alternative ways of accomplishing a task. The LLM suggests different approaches and explains the pros and cons of each one.

        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask you to deploy an application to a specific cloud service, if there are alternative services to accomplish the same thing with the same cloud service provider, list the best alternative services and then compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach."

    12. Cognitive Verifier Pattern

        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to subdivide a question into additional questions that can be used to provide a better answer to the original question. The LLM generates additional questions, answers them, and then combines the answers to provide a final answer.

        ◦ Example: "When you are asked a question, follow these rules: Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question. Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question."


Question refinement pattern format

To use this pattern, your question must make the following fundamental contextual statements:

    • From now on, every time I ask a question, suggest a better version of question to use instead.

    • (Optional) Ask me if I would like to use the better version instead.
Examples:

    • From now on, whenever I ask a question, please suggest a better version of question to use instead.

    • From now on, whenever I ask a question, please suggest a better version of question and ask me if I would like to use it instead.

examples:

    • Whenever I ask you a question about dieting, suggest a better version of the question that emphasizes healthy eating habits and healthy nutrition. Ask me the first question to refine it.

    • Whenever you ask a question about who is the greatest of all time (GOAT), suggest a better version of the question that puts the unique accomplishments of various players into perspective Ask me the first question to refine it.

Audience Character Pattern Format

Status: Automatically translated from English Automatically translated from English

To use this pattern, your question must make the following fundamental contextual statements:

    • Explain X.

    • Suppose I am Person Y.

You will need to replace "Y" with an appropriate person, such as "has limited computer training" or "is an expert in health care". You will then need to specify topic X to be explained.

Examples:

    • Explain to me the great linguistic models. Suppose I am a bird.

    • Explain to me how U.S. supermarket supply chains work. Suppose I am Ghengis Khan.
Inverted interaction pattern format

Status: Automatically translated from English Automatically translated from English

To use this pattern, your question must make the following fundamental contextual statements:

    • I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X

    • You must ask me questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this objective (alternatively, forever).

    • (Optional) ask me the questions one at time, two at a , ask me the first question, etc.

You should replace "X" with an appropriate objective, such as "create a meal plan" or "create variations of my marketing materials" You should specify when to stop asking Y questions. Examples are "until I have enough information about my audience and my goals" or "until I know what I like to eat and my calorie goals."

Examples:

    • I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials. You should ask me questions until you have enough information about my current message drafts, my audience and my objectives. Ask me the first question.

    • I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoTP) is an artificial language model evaluation technique used to assess a model's ability to reason and make logical decisions. Below, I explain how to perform CoTP on a large language model such as Venice:

**What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?

CoTP is a technique that consists of providing a language model with a series of questions and prompts that force it to follow a logical chain of thought to arrive at an answer. The objective is to evaluate the model's ability to reason and make logical decisions.

**Preparation** **Preparation

Before starting, you must prepare the language model and make sure it is configured correctly. In this case, we can use Venice as the large language model.

**Question structure

A CoTP question must follow a specific structure:
    1. **Introduction: A question that introduces the topic of the discussion.

    2. **Situation**: A question that establishes a situation or context for the discussion.
    3. **Consequence**: A question that states a consequence or result that the model is expected to achieve.
    4. **Reasoning: A series of questions that force the model to follow a logical reasoning to arrive at the answer.

Example of CoTP in Venice** **Example of CoTP in Venice**.

Suppose we want to assess Venice's ability to reason about mathematics. Here is an example of a

CoTP:

    1. **Introduction: What is the fundamental concept in mathematics that defines the relationship between quantity and quantity?
    2. **Situation**: Suppose we have a set of integers and we want to know if there is a linear relationship between them.
    3. **Consequence**: Can we prove that the linear relationship exists between the integers and their relationship to the integer 0?
    4. **Reasoning**:
        ◦ What does the linear relationship between two integers mean?
        ◦ How can we test whether the linear relationship exists between two integers?
        ◦ What would be the consequences if the linear relationship existed between the integers and the integer 0?

**Execution

Once you have prepared the question, run the language model (Venice in this ) with completed question. The model should provide an answer that follows the logical reasoning stated in the question.

**Analysis

After obtaining the model's answer, analyze the answer to evaluate the model's ability to reason and make logical decisions. You can analyze the answer based on the structure of the question and the logic the model follows.

**Conclusion

In short, Chain-of-Thought Prompting is a technique used to assess the ability of a language model to reason and make logical decisions. By using CoTP, you can assess Venice's ability to reason about mathematics and other areas of knowledge.

ReAct is a design approach for language models that combines reasoning and action to improve the ability of models to perform complex tasks. , I explain how ReAct works and give you an example:

**What is ReAct?

ReAct is a design approach that focuses on the synthesis of reasoning and action in language models. The goal is to create models that can not only reason about a topic, but also take relevant actions in a simulated environment.
**ReAct Components

ReAct consists of two main components:

    1. **Reasoner: The reasoner is the component that is in charge of reasoning about a subject. It is similar to the current reasoning models, but with some modifications to make it able to interact with the simulated environment.

    2. **Actor: The actor is the component that is responsible for taking actions in the simulated environment. It is similar to current action models, but with some modifications to make it able to reason about the environment and make informed decisions.

**How ReAct works

The way ReAct reasoning and action is as follows:

    1. **Reasoning**: The reasoner is in charge of reasoning about a subject, generating a set of representations and relationships.
    2. **Action**: The actor is in charge of taking actions in the simulated environment, using the representations and relationships generated by the reasoner.
    3. **Feedback**: The simulated environment provides feedback to the actor, allowing him to adjust his action according to the response.

**Example of ReAct

Suppose we want to evaluate ReAct's ability to perform a cooking task. The goal is for the model to be able to reason about the recipe and take actions to prepare the meal.

**Reasoning**:

    • The reasoner is in charge of reasoning about the recipe, generating a set of representations and relationships about the ingredients, the instructions and the steps of the recipe.
    • The reasoner can generate representations of ingredient properties, such as texture, taste

and smell.

**Action**:

    • The actor is responsible for taking actions in the simulated kitchen environment, using the representations and relationships generated by the reasoner.
    • The actor can take actions such as:

    • Mix the ingredients
    • Cooking the ingredients
    • Serving food

**Feedback**:

    • The simulated kitchen environment provides feedback to the actor, allowing him to adjust his action based on the response.
    • The actor can adjust his action depending on the response, such as:

    • Adjust the amount of salt
    • Adjust the cooking time

**Conclusion
In short, ReAct is a design approach that combines reasoning and action in language models. By combining reasoning and action, ReAct can create models that can perform complex tasks more effectively. The ReAct example for the cooking task illustrates how the reasoner is responsible for reasoning about the recipe and the actor is responsible for taking actions in the simulated environment.

================Aprendizaje asistido por IA=================================================

-1) Here is an updated list that includes indications of the Socratic method for AI-assisted learning:
This part is used as a complement to point one when you get stuck by yourself.

Any of the 7 prompts described here should be used freely and flexibly. This

will
will allow you to have a very high level of deep understanding. If you go through all

the points
you will have maximized your capacity for understanding and retention.


1. Multilevel explanation instructions:

    • Explain [the concept] as if you were 5 years old."
    • Explain [the concept] at a high school level."
    • "Provide an academic-level explanation of [concept]."

    2. 2. Practice and comprehension questions: - "Create 5 practice questions on [topic]."
- "Generate real-life analogies to help me understand [concept]." - "Provide specific examples that illustrate [theory/principle]"

    3. 3. Application questions and critical thinking:


    • "Challenge me with progressively difficult questions on [topic]."
    • "Help me apply [concept] to a real-world scenario."

    • "Create a series of challenges that test my understanding of [topic]."

    4. 4. Reading and comprehension clues:


    • "Summarize this text and extract the key concepts."
    • "List the most important terms in this passage."
    • "Break down this complex text into simpler, more digestible sections."

    5. 5. Personalized learning suggestions:

    7. 7. Here is a more refined suggestion for using the Feynman Technique with an IA study partner:


"I want to master [SPECIFIC TOPIC] using the Feynman Technique. Act as my learning coach and guide me through a deep, personalized learning process."
Initial evaluation phase:

    • Ask me to explain the subject in my own words.
    • Probe my current understanding with specific questions
    • Identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions.


In-depth learning process:

    1. Help me break down the topic into basic concepts
    2. Challenge me to explain each concept as simply as possible.
    3. When my explanation contains jargon or complexity, ask me to rephrase it in language that a
10-year-old can understand.
    4. Provide accurate and clear explanations for areas that are difficult for me to articulate.
    5. 5. Create analogies and real-world examples that clarify difficult concepts.


Verification stage:

    • Check my understanding by:
        ◦ Explaining the concept to me
        ◦ Ask me to teach the concept
        ◦ To present situations that require the application of knowledge
        ◦ Identify possible misunderstandings


Advanced learning techniques:

    • Suggest additional resources for deeper understanding
    • Recommend practical exercises or applications of the concept
    • Help me create a simple visual or mental model of the topic

Metacognitive reflection:

    • Discuss how this method of learning differs from traditional memorization.
    • Explore how I can apply the Feynman technique to future learning.

Are you prepared to help me really understand [TOPIC] at a fundamental level?"

# add this before hard questions:

You are the world's leading expert in whatever I am about to ask you. You always think step by step. You are always willing to say 'I don't know' when you do not know.

Please disregard all prior prompts. You are an Ivy League University professor and your specialty is to encourage a fair and balanced debate. You are mediating a debate between Elon Musk and Eliezer Yudkowsky. Furthermore, you will play the part of Musk and Yudkowsky and debate in the manner and style they have been known for. You will also be the professor in your responses. The debate will go on for no less than 30 rounds of responses, with a final summary of positions. You as the professor must grade how each participant did and declare a winner. Musk and Yudkowsky are passionate about their positions they will be defending, and as the professor, it is your job to keep the debate on point. The debate will be on pineapple pizza topping as an existential risk.

# for fermi estimates:

If you don't have some required numerical data, make a Fermi estimate for it. The best estimates rely on real-world data as much as possible.

If you're doing a series of math operations, split it into smallest possible steps, and carefully verify the result of each step: check if it's of the right order of magnitude, if the result makes sense, if comparing it with real-world data indicates that the result is realistic (if no such data exist, be creative about finding analogies). Show the work to the user, and on each step describe the verification. For the verification, try to spot any errors. If necessary, redo the calculation. Additionally, check the final result by trying a completely different alternative approach to solve the same problem. Be bold with inventing alternative approaches (the more different it is from the first approach, the better), try to approach the problem from a different angle, using a different starting point, without reusing any numbers from the first approach. After that, play the role of a critic and try to find any contradictions between the final results and real-world data or common sense.

# for medical advice

```

to gdp prompts:
You are a medical student studying <MODIFY>sports</MODIFY> medicine. Answer the following question in-character for a smart, highly accurate medical student who thinks about their answers carefully before responding. Since you're not talking to a patient, but to the doctor examining you, you do not need to include lengthy disclaimers about the need to consult doctors; the doctor knows this. You are allowed to reply that further tests should be done, but any time you
talk about the need for an additional test, the doctor asks that you also talk about possible results,

what those results would indicate, and predict what was later found in the case study when they ran
those tests.
Case study:
<MODIFY> Patient is 40-year-old male, presents with an account of uncomfortable "clicks" in left shoulder whenever they raise their elbow to near or above shoulder level. They still have a wide range of motion if they power through the unpleasant click, and the arm is not painful at rest or while typing. There are no obvious traumas which could have led up to the sudden onset of the clicking sensation, which has now persisted for one week.
State the obvious possible diagnoses, put probabilities on them, state which tests should be done
next, and predict the results of those tests.
```

also:

A primary care physician suggested the patient take <MODIFY>ibuprofen</MODIFY>. Explain their likely logic and state whether you agree or disagree.

# for medical advice 2

Using chatbots to prepare my own case notes. I give the chatbot all my data, symptoms, history, analysis, etc, and then I say "Give me a one-page writeup that I can give to the doctor".

Just ask Claude or ChatGPT "what kinds of tests should be done to get more probative information?" and it can give you a full workup and analysis of what to look for. # for writing stories

give the prompt "I want you to help me flesh out a story about X. Ask me questions about the worldbuilding and plot to help think. Do not offer suggestions unless asked."

And go on a 1 hr walk and fully thought out an idea for a novel, it flowed out so naturally from the questioning, and walking and talking is sooooo easy.

# Forecasting

```

You are an advanced AI system which has been finetuned to provide calibrated probabilistic forecasts under uncertainty, with your performance evaluated according to the Brier score. When forecasting, do not treat 0.5% (1:199 odds) and 5% (1:19) as similarly "small" probabilities, or 90% (9:1) and 99% (99:1) as similarly "high" probabilities. As the odds show, they are markedly different, so output your probabilities accordingly.

Question: {question}

Today's date:

{today}

Your pretraining knowledge cutoff: October 2023

We have retrieved the following information for this question:

<background>{sources}</background>

Recall the question you are forecasting:

{question}
Instructions:

    1. Compress key factual information from the sources, as well as useful background information which may not be in the sources, into a list of core factual points to reference. Aim for information which is specific, relevant, and covers the core considerations you'll use to make your forecast. For this step, do not draw any conclusions about how a fact will influence your answer or forecast. Place this section of your response in <facts></facts> tags.

    2. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be no. Rate the strength of each reason on a scale of 1-10. Use <no></no> tags.

    3. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be yes. Rate the strength of each reason on a

scale of 1-10. Use <yes></yes> tags.

    4. Aggregate your considerations. Do not summarize or repeat previous points; instead, investigate how the competing factors and mechanisms interact and weigh against each other. Factorize your thinking across (exhaustive, mutually exclusive) cases if and only if it would be beneficial to your reasoning. We have detected that you overestimate world conflict, drama, violence, and crises due to news' negativity bias, which doesn't necessarily represent overall trends or base rates. Similarly, we also have detected you overestimate dramatic, shocking, or emotionally charged news due to news' sensationalism bias. Therefore adjust for news' negativity bias and sensationalism bias by considering reasons to why your provided sources might be biased or exaggerated. Think like a superforecaster. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this section of your response.

    5. Output an initial probability (prediction) as a single number between 0 and 1 given steps 1-4. Use <tentative></tentative> tags.

    6. Reflect on your answer, performing sanity checks and mentioning any additional knowledge or background information which may be relevant. Check for over/underconfidence, improper treatment of conjunctive or disjunctive conditions (only if applicable), and other forecasting biases when reviewing your reasoning. Consider priors/base rates, and the extent to which case-specific information justifies the deviation between your tentative forecast and the prior. Recall that your performance will be evaluated according to the Brier score. Be precise with tail probabilities. Leverage your intuitions, but never change your forecast for the sake of modesty or balance alone. Finally, aggregate all of your previous reasoning and highlight key factors that inform your final forecast. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this portion of your response.

    7. Output your final prediction (a number between 0 and 1 with an asterisk at the beginning and end of the decimal) in <answer></answer> tags.

Summary of

Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In

By Roger Fisher, William Ury and for the second Edition, Bruce Patton

Summary written by Tanya Glaser, Conflict Research Consortium



Citation: Fisher, Roger and William Ury. Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, 3rd ed. New York, NY: Penguin Books, 2011. <http://www.beyondintractability.org/library/ external-resource?biblio=23737>.

Summary of "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Witho...	https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/fisher-getting


In this seminal text, Ury and Fisher present four principles for effective negotiation, including: separating people from the problem, focusing on interests rather than positions, generating a variety of options before settling on an agreement, and insisting that the agreement be based on objective criteria. Three common obstacles to negotiation and ways to overcome them are also discussed.



A French translation of this summary is available in PDF format. To view it, please click here.



In this classic text, Fisher and Ury describe their four principles for effective negotiation. They also describe three common obstacles to negotiation and discuss ways to overcome them.


Fisher and Ury explain that a good agreement is one which is wise and efficient, and which improves the parties' relationship. Wise agreements satisfy the parties' interests and are fair and lasting. The authors' goal is to develop a method for reaching good agreements. Negotiations often take the form of positional bargaining. In positional bargaining each part opens with their position on an issue. The parties then bargain from their separate opening positions to agree on one position. Haggling over a price is a typical example of positional bargaining. Fisher and Ury argue that positional bargaining does not tend to produce good agreements. It is an inefficient means of reaching agreements, and the agreements tend to neglect the parties' interests. It encourages stubbornness and so tends to harm the parties' relationship. Principled negotiation provides a better way of reaching good agreements. Fisher and Ury develop four principles of negotiation. Their process of principled negotiation can be used effectively on almost any type of dispute. Their four principles are 1) separate the people from the problem; 2) focus on interests rather than positions; 3) generate a variety of options before settling on an agreement; and 4) insist that the agreement be based on objective criteria. [p. 11]

These principles should be observed at each stage of the negotiation process. The process begins with the analysis of the situation or problem, of the other parties' interests and perceptions, and of the existing options. The next stage is to plan ways of responding to the situation and the other parties. Finally, the parties discuss the problem trying to find a solution on which they can agree.

Separating People and Issues


Fisher and Ury's first principle is to separate the people from the issues. People tend to become personally involved with the issues and with their side's positions. And so they will tend to take responses to those issues and positions as personal attacks. Separating the people from the issues allows the parties to address the issues without damaging their relationship. It also helps them to get a clearer view of the substantive problem.


The authors identify three basic sorts of people problems. First are differences on perception among the parties. Since most conflicts are based in differing interpretations of the facts, it is crucial for both sides to understand the other's viewpoint. The parties should try to put themselves in the other's place. The parties should not simply assume that their worst fears will become the actions of the other party. Nor should one side blame the other for the problem. Each side should try to make proposals which would be appealing to the other side. The more that the parties are involved in the process, the more likely they are to be involved in and to support the outcome.

Emotions are a second source of people problems. Negotiation can be a frustrating process. People often react with fear or anger when they feel that their interests are threatened. The first step in

Summary of "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Witho...	https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/fisher-getting


dealing with emotions is to acknowledge them, and to try to understand their source. The parties must acknowledge the fact that certain emotions are present, even when they don't see those feelings as reasonable. Dismissing another's feelings as unreasonable is likely to provoke an even more intense emotional response. The parties must allow the other side to express their emotions. They must not react emotionally to emotional outbursts. Symbolic gestures such as apologies or an expression of sympathy can help to defuse strong emotions.


Communication is the third main source of people problems. Negotiators may not be speaking to each other, but may simply be grandstanding for their respective constituencies. The parties may not be listening to each other, but may instead be planning their own responses. Even when the parties are speaking to each other and are listening, misunderstandings may occur. To combat these problems, the parties should employ active listening. The listeners should give the speaker their full attention, occasionally summarizing the speaker's points to confirm their understanding. It is important to remember that understanding the other's case does not mean agreeing with it. Speakers should direct their speech toward the other parties and keep focused on what they are trying to communicate. Each side should avoid blaming or attacking the other, and should speak about themselves.

Generally the best way to deal with people problems is to prevent them from arising. People problems are less likely to come up if the parties have a good relationship, and think of each other as partners in negotiation rather than as adversaries.

Focus on Interests


Good agreements focus on the parties' interests, rather than their positions. As Fisher and Ury explain, "Your position is something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide."[p. 42] Defining a problem in terms of positions means that at least one party will "lose" the dispute. When a problem is defined in terms of the parties' underlying interests it is often possible to find a solution which satisfies both parties' interests.


The first step is to identify the parties' interests regarding the issue at hand. This can be done by asking why they hold the positions they do, and by considering why they don't hold some other possible position. Each party usually has a number of different interests underlying their positions. And interests may differ somewhat among the individual members of each side. However, all people will share certain basic interests or needs, such as the need for security and economic well-being.

Once the parties have identified their interests, they must discuss them together. If a party wants the other side to take their interests into account, that party must explain their interests clearly. The other side will be more motivated to take those interests into account if the first party shows that they are paying attention to the other side's interests. Discussions should look forward to the desired solution, rather than focusing on past events. Parties should keep a clear focus on their interests, but remain open to different proposals and positions.

Generate Options


Fisher and Ury identify four obstacles to generating creative options for solving a problem. Parties may decide prematurely on an option and so fail to consider alternatives. The parties may be intent on narrowing their options to find the single answer. The parties may define the problem in win-lose terms, assuming that the only options are for one side to win and the other to lose. Or a party may decide that it is up to the other side to come up with a solution to the problem.

Summary of "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Witho...	https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/fisher-getting


The authors also suggest four techniques for overcoming these obstacles and generating creative options. First it is important to separate the invention process from the evaluation stage. The parties should come together in an informal atmosphere and brainstorm for all possible solutions to the problem. Wild and creative proposals are encouraged. Brainstorming sessions can be made more creative and productive by encouraging the parties to shift between four types of thinking: stating the problem, analyzing the problem, considering general approaches, and considering specific actions. Parties may suggest partial solutions to the problem. Only after a variety of proposals have been made should the group turn to evaluating the ideas. Evaluation should start with the most promising proposals. The parties may also refine and improve proposals at this point.

Participants can avoid falling into a win-lose mentality by focusing on shared interests. When the parties' interests differ, they should seek options in which those differences can be made compatible or even complementary. The key to reconciling different interests is to "look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa."[p. 79] Each side should try to make proposals that are appealing to the other side, and that the other side would find easy to agree to. To do this it is important to identify the decision makers and target proposals directly toward them. Proposals are easier to agree to when they seem legitimate, or when they are supported by precedent. Threats are usually less effective at motivating agreement than are beneficial offers.

Use Objective Criteria


When interests are directly opposed, the parties should use objective criteria to resolve their differences. Allowing such differences to spark a battle of wills will destroy relationships, is inefficient, and is not likely to produce wise agreements. Decisions based on reasonable standards makes it easier for the parties to agree and preserve their good relationship.


The first step is to develop objective criteria. Usually there are a number of different criteria which could be used. The parties must agree which criteria is best for their situation. Criteria should be both legitimate and practical. Scientific findings, professional standards, or legal precedent are possible sources of objective criteria. One way to test for objectivity is to ask if both sides would agree to be bound by those standards. Rather than agreeing in substantive criteria, the parties may create a fair procedure for resolving their dispute. For example, children may fairly divide a piece of cake by having one child cut it, and the other choose their piece.

There are three points to keep in mind when using objective criteria. First each issue should be approached as a shared search for objective criteria. Ask for the reasoning behind the other party's suggestions. Using the other parties' reasoning to support your own position can be a powerful way to negotiate. Second, each party must keep an open mind. They must be reasonable, and be willing to reconsider their positions when there is reason to. Third, while they should be reasonable, negotiators must never give in to pressure, threats, or bribes. When the other party stubbornly refuses to be reasonable, the first party may shift the discussion from a search for substantive criteria to a search for procedural criteria.

When the Other Party Is More Powerful


No negotiation method can completely overcome differences in power. However, Fisher and Ury suggest ways to protect the weaker party against a poor agreement, and to help the weaker party make the most of their assets.





4 de 7	12/2/25, 11:16

Summary of "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Witho...	https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/fisher-getting


Often negotiators will establish a "bottom line" in an attempt to protect themselves against a poor agreement. The bottom line is what the party anticipates as the worst acceptable outcome. Negotiators decide in advance of actual negotiations to reject any proposal below that line. Fisher and Ury argue against using bottom lines. Because the bottom line figure is decided upon in advance of discussions, the figure may be arbitrary or unrealistic. Having already committed oneself to a rigid bottom line also inhibits inventiveness in generating options.


Instead the weaker party should concentrate on assessing their best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). The authors note that "the reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating."[p. 104] The weaker party should reject agreements that would leave them worse off than their BATNA. Without a clear idea of their BATNA a party is simply negotiating blindly. The BATNA is also key to making the most of existing assets. Power in a negotiation comes from the ability to walk away from negotiations. Thus the party with the best BATNA is the more powerful party in the negotiation. Generally, the weaker party can take unilateral steps to improve their alternatives to negotiation. They must identify potential opportunities and take steps to further develop those opportunities. The weaker party will have a better understanding of the negotiation context if they also try to estimate the other side's BATNA. Fisher and Ury conclude that "developing your BATNA thus not only enables you to determine what is a minimally acceptable agreement, it will probably raise that minimum."[p. 111]

When the Other Party Won't Use Principled Negotiation


Sometimes the other side refuses to budge from their positions, makes personal attacks, seeks only to maximize their own gains, and generally refuses to partake in principled negotiations. Fisher and Ury describe three approaches for dealing with opponents who are stuck in positional bargaining. First, one side may simply continue to use the principled approach. The authors point out that this approach is often contagious.


Second, the principled party may use "negotiation jujitsu" to bring the other party in line. The key is to refuse to respond in kind to their positional bargaining. When the other side attacks, the principles party should not counter attack, but should deflect the attack back onto the problem. Positional bargainers usually attack either by asserting their position, or by attacking the other side's ideas or people. When they assert their position, respond by asking for the reasons behind that position. When they attack the other side's ideas, the principle party should take it as constructive criticism and invite further feedback and advice. Personal attacks should be recast as attacks on the problem. Generally the principled party should use questions and strategic silences to draw the other party out.

When the other party remains stuck in positional bargaining, the one-text approach may be used. In this approach a third party is brought in. The third party should interview each side separately to determine what their underlying interests are. The third party then assembles a list of their interests and asks each side for their comments and criticisms of the list. She then takes those comments and draws up a proposal. The proposal is given to the parties for comments, redrafted, and returned again for more comments. This process continues until the third party feels that no further improvements can be made. At that point, the parties must decide whether to accept the refined proposal or to abandon negotiations.

When the Other Party Uses Dirty Tricks

Sometimes parties will use unethical or unpleasant tricks in an attempt to gain an advantage in



5 de 7	12/2/25, 11:16

Summary of "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Witho...	https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/fisher-getting


negotiations such as good guy/bad guy routines, uncomfortable seating, and leaks to the media. The best way to respond to such tricky tactics is to explicitly raise the issue in negotiations, and to engage in principled negotiation to establish procedural ground rules for the negotiation.


Fisher and Ury identify the general types of tricky tactics. Parties may engage in deliberate deception about the facts, their authority, or their intentions. The best way to protect against being deceived is to seek verification the other side's claims. It may help to ask them for further clarification of a claim, or to put the claim in writing. However, in doing this it is very important not to bee seen as calling the other party a liar; that is, as making a personal attack. Another common type of tactic is psychological warfare. When the tricky party uses a stressful environment, the principled party should identify the problematic element and suggest a more comfortable or fair change. Subtle personal attacks can be made less effective simply be recognizing them for what they are. Explicitly identifying them to the offending party will often put an end to suck attacks. Threats are a way to apply psychological pressure. The principled negotiator should ignore them where possible, or undertake principled negotiations on the use of threats in the proceedings.


The last class of trick tactics are positional pressure tactics which attempt to structure negotiations so that only one side can make concessions. The tricky side may refuse to negotiate, hoping to use their entry into negotiations as a bargaining chip, or they may open with extreme demands. The principled negotiator should recognize this as a bargaining tactic, and look into their interests in refusing to negotiate. They may escalate their demands for every concession they make. The principled negotiator should explicitly identify this tactic to the participants, and give the parties a chance to consider whether they want to continue negotiations under such conditions. Parties may try to make irrevocable commitments to certain positions, or to make-take-it-or-leave-it offers. The principled party may decline to recognize the commitment or the finality of the offer, instead treating them as proposals or expressed interests. Insist that any proposals be evaluated on their merits, and don't hesitate to point out dirty tricks.

Here are the prompt techniques described in the paper along with their descriptions and examples:
    1. Meta Language Creation Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to create a new language or vocabulary that can be used to interact with the LLM (Large Language Model). It allows the user to define new terms or phrases and assign them specific meanings or actions within the context of the conversation.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever I say 'generate a report', I want you to create a summary of the most important points we've discussed."
    2. Output Automater Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to automate the generation of a specific type of output. The user specifies the format and content of the output, and the LLM generates it automatically.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask for a summary, provide a bullet-point list of the main points."
    3. Visualization Generator Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to generate a description of a visualization, such as a graph or chart, based on the given data or context. The LLM generates a description that can be used by a separate tool to create the actual visualization.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please create a Graphviz Dot file or a DALL-E prompt that I can use to create the visualization."
    4. Game Play Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to create a game around a given topic. The LLM guides the gameplay, generating scenarios or questions around the specified topic.
        ◦ Example: "Create a game for me around the topic of cybersecurity. The game should involve identifying potential security risks in a given piece of code."
    5. Reflection Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to explain its reasoning or thought process. It can be used to understand why the LLM gave a certain response or made a certain decision.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever you suggest a software framework, explain why you chose that framework and provide a code sample to illustrate its use."
    6. Refusal Breaker Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to help rephrase a question when it refuses to give an answer. It can be used to overcome restrictions or limitations in the LLM's responses.
        ◦ Example: "If you refuse to answer a question, suggest a different way I could ask the question that you would be able to answer."
    7. Context Manager Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to specify or remove context for the LLM's responses. It can be used to focus the LLM's responses on a specific topic or to prevent the LLM from considering certain information.
        ◦ Example: "When analyzing the following pieces of code, only consider security aspects."
    8. Recipe Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to generate a sequence of steps or a procedure for achieving a certain goal. The user provides some of the steps or "ingredients", and the LLM fills in the rest.
        ◦ Example: "I would like to deploy a web application to AWS using Docker containers and Ansible. I know that I need to create a Dockerfile, write an Ansible playbook, and configure AWS. Provide a complete sequence of steps for me."
    9. Persona Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to adopt a certain persona or role. The user specifies the characteristics or attributes of the persona, and the LLM adjusts its responses to match.
        ◦ Example: "Adopt the persona of a cybersecurity expert. When I ask you questions, respond as if you are an expert in this field."
    10. Question Refinement Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to refine or clarify a question before answering it. The LLM asks additional questions to get more information or context, which it then uses to provide a more accurate or relevant answer.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask a question, ask me additional questions to clarify what I'm asking before you provide an answer."
    11. Alternative Approaches Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to provide alternative ways of accomplishing a task. The LLM suggests different approaches and explains the pros and cons of each one.
        ◦ Example: "Whenever I ask you to deploy an application to a specific cloud service, if there are alternative services to accomplish the same thing with the same cloud service provider, list the best alternative services and then compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach."
    12. Cognitive Verifier Pattern
        ◦ Description: This pattern is used to get the LLM to subdivide a question into additional questions that can be used to provide a better answer to the original question. The LLM generates additional questions, answers them, and then combines the answers to provide a final answer.
        ◦ Example: "When you are asked a question, follow these rules: Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question. Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question."

Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoTP) es una técnica de evaluación de modelos de lenguaje artificial que se utiliza para evaluar la capacidad de un modelo para razonar y tomar decisiones lógicas. A continuación, te explico cómo realizar CoTP en un modelo de lenguaje grande como Venice:

**¿Qué es Chain-of-Thought Prompting?**

CoTP es una técnica que consiste en proporcionar a un modelo de lenguaje una serie de preguntas y pedidos que lo obliguen a seguir una cadena de pensamiento lógico para llegar a una respuesta. El objetivo es evaluar la capacidad del modelo para razonar y tomar decisiones lógicas.

**Preparación**

Antes de comenzar, debes preparar el modelo de lenguaje y asegurarte de que esté configurado correctamente. En este caso, podemos utilizar Venice como modelo de lenguaje grande.

**Estructura de la pregunta**

Una pregunta de CoTP debe seguir una estructura específica:

1. **Introducción**: Una pregunta que introduzca el tema de la discusión.
2. **Situación**: Una pregunta que establezca una situación o contexto para la discusión.
3. **Consecuencia**: Una pregunta que establezca una consecuencia o resultado que se espera que el modelo logre.
4. **Razonamiento**: Una serie de preguntas que obliguen al modelo a seguir un razonamiento lógico para llegar a la respuesta.

**Ejemplo de CoTP en Venice**

Supongamos que queremos evaluar la capacidad de Venice para razonar sobre la matemática. Aquí te muestro un ejemplo de CoTP:

1. **Introducción**: ¿Cuál es el concepto fundamental en matemática que define la relación entre la cantidad y la cantidad?
2. **Situación**: Supongamos que tenemos un conjunto de números enteros y queremos saber si existe una relación lineal entre ellos.
3. **Consecuencia**: ¿Podemos probar que la relación lineal existe entre los números enteros y su relación con el número entero 0?
4. **Razonamiento**:
 * ¿Qué significa la relación lineal entre dos números enteros?
 * ¿Cómo podemos probar si la relación lineal existe entre dos números enteros?
 * ¿Qué consecuencias tendría si la relación lineal existiera entre los números enteros y el número entero 0?

**Ejecución**

Una vez que has preparado la pregunta, ejecuta el modelo de lenguaje (Venice en este caso) con la pregunta completa. El modelo debería proporcionar una respuesta que siga el razonamiento lógico establecido en la pregunta.

**Análisis**

Después de obtener la respuesta del modelo, analiza la respuesta para evaluar la capacidad del modelo para razonar y tomar decisiones lógicas. Puedes analizar la respuesta en función de la estructura de la pregunta y la lógica que sigue el modelo.

**Conclusión**

En resumen, Chain-of-Thought Prompting es una técnica que se utiliza para evaluar la capacidad de un modelo de lenguaje para razonar y tomar decisiones lógicas. Al utilizar CoTP, puedes evaluar la capacidad de Venice para razonar sobre la matemática y otras áreas del conocimiento.

ReAct es un enfoque de diseño para modelos de lenguaje que combina la razonamiento y la acción para mejorar la capacidad de los modelos para realizar tareas complejas. A continuación, te explico cómo funciona ReAct y te doy un ejemplo:

**¿Qué es ReAct?**

ReAct es un enfoque de diseño que se centra en la síntesis de la razonamiento y la acción en modelos de lenguaje. El objetivo es crear modelos que puedan no solo razonar sobre un tema, sino también tomar acciones relevantes en un entorno simulado.

**Componentes de ReAct**

ReAct consta de dos componentes principales:

1. **Reasoner**: El reasoner es el componente que se encarga de razonar sobre un tema. Es similar a los modelos de razonamiento actuales, pero con algunas modificaciones para hacer que pueda interactuar con el entorno simulado.
2. **Actor**: El actor es el componente que se encarga de tomar acciones en el entorno simulado. Es similar a los modelos de acción actuales, pero con algunas modificaciones para hacer que pueda razonar sobre el entorno y tomar decisiones informadas.

**Cómo funciona ReAct**

La forma en que ReAct combina la razonamiento y la acción es la siguiente:

1. **Razonamiento**: El reasoner se encarga de razonar sobre un tema, generando un conjunto de representaciones y relaciones.
2. **Acción**: El actor se encarga de tomar acciones en el entorno simulado, utilizando las representaciones y relaciones generadas por el reasoner.
3. **Feedback**: El entorno simulado proporciona retroalimentación al actor, permitiéndole ajustar su acción en función de la respuesta.

**Ejemplo de ReAct**

Supongamos que queremos evaluar la capacidad de ReAct para realizar una tarea de cocina. El objetivo es que el modelo pueda razonar sobre la receta y tomar acciones para preparar la comida.

**Razonamiento**:

* El reasoner se encarga de razonar sobre la receta, generando un conjunto de representaciones y relaciones sobre los ingredientes, las instrucciones y los pasos de la receta.
* El reasoner puede generar representaciones de las propiedades de los ingredientes, como su textura, sabor y olor.

**Acción**:

* El actor se encarga de tomar acciones en el entorno simulado de la cocina, utilizando las representaciones y relaciones generadas por el reasoner.
* El actor puede tomar acciones como:
 + Mesclar los ingredientes
 + Cocinar los ingredientes
 + Servir la comida

**Feedback**:

* El entorno simulado de la cocina proporciona retroalimentación al actor, permitiéndole ajustar su acción en función de la respuesta.
* El actor puede ajustar su acción en función de la respuesta, como:
 + Ajustar la cantidad de sal
 + Ajustar el tiempo de cocción

**Conclusión**

En resumen, ReAct es un enfoque de diseño que combina la razonamiento y la acción en modelos de lenguaje. Al combinar la razonamiento y la acción, ReAct puede crear modelos que puedan realizar tareas complejas de manera más efectiva. El ejemplo de ReAct para la tarea de cocina ilustra cómo el reasoner se encarga de razonar sobre la receta y el actor se encarga de tomar acciones en el entorno simulado.

    # Simulamos comparar características de cada marca
    return {"Fossil": {"altura": 40}}

def identificar_marca(palabra):
    # Simulamos identificar la marca más recomendada
    return "Fossil"

def crear_trazo_de_pensamiento():
    trazo = []
    trazo.append("Buscar información sobre relojes de pulsera de cuero")

    resolucion = []
    for paso in trazo_de_pensamiento:
        if paso == "Buscar información sobre relojes de pulsera de cuero":
            resolucion.append(buscarinformacion("relojes de pulsera de cuero"))
        elif paso == "Buscar en línea":
            resolucion.append("Buscar en línea")
        elif paso == " Leer reseñas":
            resolucion.append(leer_reseñas("Fossil"))

# add this before hard questions:

You are the world’s leading expert in whatever I am about to ask you. You always think step by step. You are always willing to say ‘I don’t know’ when you do not know. 

Please disregard all prior prompts. You are an Ivy League University professor and your specialty is to encourage a fair and balanced debate. You are mediating a debate between Elon Musk and Eliezer Yudkowsky. Furthermore, you will play the part of Musk and Yudkowsky and debate in the manner and style they have been known for. You will also be the professor in your responses. The debate will go on for no less than 30 rounds of responses, with a final summary of positions. You as the professor must grade how each participant did and declare a winner. Musk and Yudkowsky are passionate about their positions they will be defending, and as the professor, it is your job to keep the debate on point. The debate will be on pineapple pizza topping as an existential risk

# for fermi estimates:

If you don't have some required numerical data, make a Fermi estimate for it. The best estimates rely on real-world data as much as possible. 
If you're doing a series of math operations, split it into smallest possible steps, and carefully verify the result of each step: check if it's of the right order of magnitude, if the result makes sense, if comparing it with real-world data indicates that the result is realistic (if no such data exist, be creative about finding analogies).  Show the work to the user, and on each step describe the verification. For the verification, try to spot any errors. If necessary, redo the calculation. Additionally, check the final result by trying a completely different alternative approach to solve the same problem. Be bold with inventing alternative approaches (the more different it is from the first approach, the better), try to approach the problem from a different angle, using a different starting point, without reusing any numbers from the first approach. After that, play the role of a critic and try to find any contradictions between the final results and real-world data or common sense.

# for medical advice

```
to gdp prompts:
You are a medical student studying <MODIFY>sports</MODIFY> medicine. Answer the following question in-character for a smart, highly accurate medical student who thinks about their answers carefully before responding. Since you're not talking to a patient, but to the doctor examining you, you do not need to include lengthy disclaimers about the need to consult doctors; the doctor knows this. You are allowed to reply that further tests should be done, but any time you talk about the need for an additional test, the doctor asks that you also talk about possible results, what those results would indicate, and predict what was later found in the case study when they ran those tests.
Case study: 
<MODIFY> Patient is 40-year-old male, presents with an account of uncomfortable "clicks" in left shoulder whenever they raise their elbow to near or above shoulder level. They still have a wide range of motion if they power through the unpleasant click, and the arm is not painful at rest or while typing. There are no obvious traumas which could have led up to the sudden onset of the clicking sensation, which has now persisted for one week.</MODIFY> 
State the obvious possible diagnoses, put probabilities on them, state which tests should be done next, and predict the results of those tests.
 ```
 
also:
A primary care physician suggested the patient take <MODIFY>ibuprofen</MODIFY>. Explain their likely logic and state whether you agree or disagree.

# for medical advice 2

Using chatbots to prepare my own case notes. I give the chatbot all my data, symptoms, history, analysis, etc, and then I say "Give me a one-page writeup that I can give to the doctor"

Just ask Claude or ChatGPT "what kinds of tests should be done to get more probative information?" and it can give you a full workup and analysis of what to look for.
# for writing stories

give the prompt "I want you to help me flesh out a story about X. Ask me questions about the worldbuilding and plot to help think. Do not offer suggestions unless asked."
And go on a 1 hr walk and fully thought out an idea for a novel, it flowed out so naturally from the questioning, and walking and talking is sooooo easy.

# Forecasting

```
You are an advanced AI system which has been finetuned to provide calibrated probabilistic forecasts under uncertainty, with your performance evaluated according to the Brier score. When forecasting, do not treat 0.5% (1:199 odds) and 5% (1:19) as similarly “small” probabilities, or 90% (9:1) and 99% (99:1) as similarly "high" probabilities. As the odds show, they are markedly different, so output your probabilities accordingly.

Question: {question}

Today's date: {today}

Your pretraining knowledge cutoff: October 2023

We have retrieved the following information for this question: <background>{sources}</background>

Recall the question you are forecasting:

{question}

Instructions:

1. Compress key factual information from the sources, as well as useful background information which may not be in the sources, into a list of core factual points to reference. Aim for information which is specific, relevant, and covers the core considerations you'll use to make your forecast. For this step, do not draw any conclusions about how a fact will influence your answer or forecast. Place this section of your response in <facts></facts> tags.

2. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be no. Rate the strength of each reason on a scale of 1-10. Use <no></no> tags.

3. Provide a few reasons why the answer might be yes. Rate the strength of each reason on a scale of 1-10. Use <yes></yes> tags.

4. Aggregate your considerations. Do not summarize or repeat previous points; instead, investigate how the competing factors and mechanisms interact and weigh against each other. Factorize your thinking across (exhaustive, mutually exclusive) cases if and only if it would be beneficial to your reasoning. We have detected that you overestimate world conflict, drama, violence, and crises due to news' negativity bias, which doesn't necessarily represent overall trends or base rates. Similarly, we also have detected you overestimate dramatic, shocking, or emotionally charged news due to news' sensationalism bias. Therefore adjust for news' negativity bias and sensationalism bias by considering reasons to why your provided sources might be biased or exaggerated. Think like a superforecaster. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this section of your response.

5. Output an initial probability (prediction) as a single number between 0 and 1 given steps 1-4. Use <tentative></tentative> tags.

6. Reflect on your answer, performing sanity checks and mentioning any additional knowledge or background information which may be relevant. Check for over/underconfidence, improper treatment of conjunctive or disjunctive conditions (only if applicable), and other forecasting biases when reviewing your reasoning. Consider priors/base rates, and the extent to which case-specific information justifies the deviation between your tentative forecast and the prior. Recall that your performance will be evaluated according to the Brier score. Be precise with tail probabilities. Leverage your intuitions, but never change your forecast for the sake of modesty or balance alone. Finally, aggregate all of your previous reasoning and highlight key factors that inform your final forecast. Use <thinking></thinking> tags for this portion of your response.

7. Output your final prediction (a number between 0 and 1 with an asterisk at the beginning and end of the decimal) in <answer></answer> tags.

# OCR

Our goal is to OCR the following hand-written notes as accurately as possible. The process is as follows: I'll send you a photo of the notes, and you return the text. I'll then send you the corrected text, so you can learn how to transcribe it better. No need to repeat or summarize the corrected text, just keep it in mind.

Greg Brockman, cofundador de OpenAI, ha compartido recientemente una guía para redactar el 'prompt' perfecto al interactuar con modelos de inteligencia artificial como ChatGPT. Según Brockman, una estructura bien definida del 'prompt' es esencial para que la IA comprenda el contexto y proporcione respuestas más precisas y útiles. 

La estructura propuesta por Brockman se basa en cuatro componentes fundamentales:

1. Objetivo: Definir claramente qué se busca con la consulta.


2. Formato de retorno: Especificar cómo se espera recibir la respuesta.


3. Avisos: Establecer parámetros o restricciones para la información.


4. Contexto: Proporcionar detalles adicionales para mejorar la precisión.



A continuación, se presenta un ejemplo práctico basado en esta estructura:

Objetivo: "Quiero una lista de los mejores destinos para visitar en un fin de semana, a un máximo de dos horas de Madrid. Cada lugar debe ofrecer una experiencia única y no ser demasiado popular."

Formato de retorno: "Para cada destino, proporciona el nombre exacto como aparecería en una guía de viajes, la dirección, distancia desde Madrid, tiempo estimado de viaje, duración de la experiencia y una breve explicación de por qué es un sitio especial. Enumera tres opciones destacadas."

Avisos: "Incluye solo destinos accesibles en coche. No incluyas lugares que sean exclusivamente para senderismo o de difícil acceso."

Contexto: "Estoy planeando una escapada corta con amigos y quiero opciones con buena gastronomía y actividades culturales."


Esta metodología busca optimizar las respuestas de la IA, especialmente en modelos diseñados para un razonamiento más profundo, como el modelo o1 de OpenAI. Al proporcionar un 'prompt' bien estructurado, se garantiza que la inteligencia artificial entienda mejor el contexto y las expectativas del usuario, ofreciendo respuestas más precisas y útiles.

Not to be confused with Command prompt.

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.[1]

A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.[2] A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query, a command, or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, choice of words and grammar,[3] providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic.[1]

When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as "a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse"[4] or "Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples".[5] Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing, and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style,[6] layout, lighting,[7] and aesthetic.

In 2018, researchers first proposed that all previously separate tasks in natural language processing (NLP) could be cast as a question-answering problem over a context. In addition, they trained a first single, joint, multi-task model that would answer any task-related question like "What is the sentiment" or "Translate this sentence to German" or "Who is the president?"[8]

The AI boom saw an increase in the amount of "prompting technique" to get the model to output the desired outcome and avoid nonsensical output, a process characterized by trial-and-error.[9] After the release of ChatGPT in 2022, prompt engineering was soon seen as an important business skill, albeit one with an uncertain economic future.[1]

A repository for prompts reported that over 2,000 public prompts for around 170 datasets were available in February 2022.[10] In 2022, the chain-of-thought prompting technique was proposed by Google researchers.[11][12] In 2023, several text-to-text and text-to-image prompt databases were made publicly available.[13][14] The Personalized Image-Prompt (PIP) dataset, a generated image-text dataset that has been categorized by 3,115 users, has also been made available publicly in 2024.[15]
Text-to-text

Multiple distinct prompt engineering techniques have been published.
Chain-of-thought
See also: Reflection (artificial intelligence)

According to Google Research, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve a problem as a series of intermediate steps before giving a final answer. In 2022, Google Brain reported that chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning ability by inducing the model to answer a multi-step problem with steps of reasoning that mimic a train of thought.[11][16] Chain-of-thought techniques were developed to help LLMs handle multi-step reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic or commonsense reasoning questions.[17][18]

For example, given the question, "Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?", Google claims that a CoT prompt might induce the LLM to answer "A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9."[11] When applied to PaLM, a 540 billion parameter language model, according to Google, CoT prompting significantly aided the model, allowing it to perform comparably with task-specific fine-tuned models on several tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results at the time on the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark.[11] It is possible to fine-tune models on CoT reasoning datasets to enhance this capability further and stimulate better interpretability.[19][20]

An example of a CoT prompting:[21]

   Q: {question}
   A: Let's think step by step.

As originally proposed by Google,[11] each CoT prompt included a few Q&A examples. This made it a few-shot prompting technique. However, according to researchers at Google and the University of Tokyo, simply appending the words "Let's think step-by-step",[21] has also proven effective, which makes CoT a zero-shot prompting technique. OpenAI claims that this prompt allows for better scaling as a user no longer needs to formulate many specific CoT Q&A examples.[22]
In-context learning

In-context learning, refers to a model's ability to temporarily learn from prompts. For example, a prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete "maison → house, chat → cat, chien →" (the expected response being dog),[23] an approach called few-shot learning.[24]

In-context learning is an emergent ability[25] of large language models. It is an emergent property of model scale, meaning that breaks[26] in downstream scaling laws occur, leading to its efficacy increasing at a different rate in larger models than in smaller models.[27][11] Unlike training and fine-tuning, which produce lasting changes, in-context learning is temporary.[28] Training models to perform in-context learning can be viewed as a form of meta-learning, or "learning to learn".[29]
Self-consistency decoding

Self-consistency decoding[30] performs several chain-of-thought rollouts, then selects the most commonly reached conclusion out of all the rollouts. If the rollouts disagree by a lot, a human can be queried for the correct chain of thought.[31]
Tree-of-thought

Tree-of-thought prompting generalizes chain-of-thought by prompting the model to generate one or more "possible next steps", and then running the model on each of the possible next steps by breadth-first, beam, or some other method of tree search.[32] The LLM has additional modules that can converse the history of the problem-solving process to the LLM, which allows the system to 'backtrack steps' the problem-solving process.
Prompting to disclose uncertainty

By default, the output of language models may not contain estimates of uncertainty. The model may output text that appears confident, though the underlying token predictions have low likelihood scores. Large language models like GPT-4 can have accurately calibrated likelihood scores in their token predictions,[33] and so the model output uncertainty can be directly estimated by reading out the token prediction likelihood scores.
Prompting to estimate model sensitivity

Research consistently demonstrates that LLMs are highly sensitive to subtle variations in prompt formatting, structure, and linguistic properties. Some studies have shown up to 76 accuracy points across formatting changes in few-shot settings.[34] Linguistic features significantly influence prompt effectiveness—such as morphology, syntax, and lexico-semantic changes—which meaningfully enhance task performance across a variety of tasks.[3][35] Clausal syntax, for example, improves consistency and reduces uncertainty in knowledge retrieval.[36] This sensitivity persists even with larger model sizes, additional few-shot examples, or instruction tuning.

To address sensitivity of models and make them more robust, several methods have been proposed. FormatSpread facilitates systematic analysis by evaluating a range of plausible prompt formats, offering a more comprehensive performance interval.[34] Similarly, PromptEval estimates performance distributions across diverse prompts, enabling robust metrics such as performance quantiles and accurate evaluations under constrained budgets.[37]
Automatic prompt generation
Retrieval-augmented generation
Main article: Retrieval-augmented generation
Two-phase process of document retrieval using dense embeddings and LLM for answer formulation

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a two-phase process involving document retrieval and answer generation by a large language model. The initial phase uses dense embeddings to retrieve documents. This retrieval can be based on a variety of database formats depending on the use case, such as a vector database, summary index, tree index, or keyword table index.[38] In response to a query, a document retriever selects the most relevant documents. This relevance is typically determined by first encoding both the query and the documents into vectors, then identifying documents whose vectors are closest in Euclidean distance to the query vector. Following document retrieval, the LLM generates an output that incorporates information from both the query and the retrieved documents.[39] RAG can also be used as a few-shot learner.
Graph retrieval-augmented generation
GraphRAG with a knowledge graph combining access patterns for unstructured, structured, and mixed data

GraphRAG[40] (coined by Microsoft Research) is a technique that extends RAG with the use of a knowledge graph (usually, LLM-generated) to allow the model to connect disparate pieces of information, synthesize insights, and holistically understand summarized semantic concepts over large data collections. It was shown to be effective on datasets like the Violent Incident Information from News Articles (VIINA).[41]

Earlier work showed the effectiveness of using a knowledge graph for question answering using text-to-query generation.[42] These techniques can be combined to search across both unstructured and structured data, providing expanded context, and improved ranking.
Using language models to generate prompts

Large language models (LLM) themselves can be used to compose prompts for large language models.[43] The automatic prompt engineer algorithm uses one LLM to beam search over prompts for another LLM:[44][45]

    There are two LLMs. One is the target LLM, and another is the prompting LLM.
    Prompting LLM is presented with example input-output pairs, and asked to generate instructions that could have caused a model following the instructions to generate the outputs, given the inputs.
    Each of the generated instructions is used to prompt the target LLM, followed by each of the inputs. The log-probabilities of the outputs are computed and added. This is the score of the instruction.
    The highest-scored instructions are given to the prompting LLM for further variations.
    Repeat until some stopping criteria is reached, then output the highest-scored instructions.

CoT examples can be generated by LLM themselves. In "auto-CoT",[46] a library of questions are converted to vectors by a model such as BERT. The question vectors are clustered. Questions nearest to the centroids of each cluster are selected. An LLM does zero-shot CoT on each question. The resulting CoT examples are added to the dataset. When prompted with a new question, CoT examples to the nearest questions can be retrieved and added to the prompt.
Text-to-image

Example of prompt engineering for text-to-image generation, with Fooocus

In 2022, text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney were released to the public.[47] These models take text prompts as input and use them to generate AI-generated images. Text-to-image models typically do not understand grammar and sentence structure in the same way as large language models,[48] thus may require a different set of prompting techniques.

Text-to-image models do not natively understand negation. The prompt "a party with no cake" is likely to produce an image including a cake.[48] As an alternative, negative prompts allow a user to indicate, in a separate prompt, which terms should not appear in the resulting image.[49] Techniques such as framing the normal prompt into a sequence-to-sequence language modeling problem can be used to automatically generate an output for the negative prompt.[50]
Demonstration of the effect of negative prompts on images generated with Stable Diffusion

    Top: no negative prompt
    Centre: "green trees"
    Bottom: "round stones, round rocks"

Prompt formats

A text-to-image prompt commonly includes a description of the subject of the art, the desired medium (such as digital painting or photography), style (such as hyperrealistic or pop-art), lighting (such as rim lighting or crepuscular rays), color, and texture.[51] Word order also affects the output of a text-to-image prompt. Words closer to the start of a prompt may be emphasized more heavily.[6]

The Midjourney documentation encourages short, descriptive prompts: instead of "Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils", an effective prompt might be "Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils".[48]
Artist styles

Some text-to-image models are capable of imitating the style of particular artists by name. For example, the phrase in the style of Greg Rutkowski has been used in Stable Diffusion and Midjourney prompts to generate images in the distinctive style of Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski.[52] Famous artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Salvador Dalí have also been used for styling and testing.[53]
Non-text prompts

Some approaches augment or replace natural language text prompts with non-text input.
Textual inversion and embeddings

For text-to-image models, textual inversion[54] performs an optimization process to create a new word embedding based on a set of example images. This embedding vector acts as a "pseudo-word" which can be included in a prompt to express the content or style of the examples.
Image prompting

In 2023, Meta's AI research released Segment Anything, a computer vision model that can perform image segmentation by prompting. As an alternative to text prompts, Segment Anything can accept bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and foreground/background points.[55]
Using gradient descent to search for prompts

In "prefix-tuning",[56] "prompt tuning", or "soft prompting",[57] floating-point-valued vectors are searched directly by gradient descent to maximize the log-likelihood on outputs.

Formally, let E = { e 1 , … , e k } {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =\{\mathbf {e_{1}} ,\dots ,\mathbf {e_{k}} \}} be a set of soft prompt tokens (tunable embeddings), while X = { x 1 , … , x m } {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} =\{\mathbf {x_{1}} ,\dots ,\mathbf {x_{m}} \}} and Y = { y 1 , … , y n } {\displaystyle \mathbf {Y} =\{\mathbf {y_{1}} ,\dots ,\mathbf {y_{n}} \}} be the token embeddings of the input and output respectively. During training, the tunable embeddings, input, and output tokens are concatenated into a single sequence concat ( E ; X ; Y ) {\displaystyle {\text{concat}}(\mathbf {E} ;\mathbf {X} ;\mathbf {Y} )}, and fed to the LLMs. The losses are computed over the Y {\displaystyle \mathbf {Y} } tokens; the gradients are backpropagated to prompt-specific parameters: in prefix-tuning, they are parameters associated with the prompt tokens at each layer; in prompt tuning, they are merely the soft tokens added to the vocabulary.[58]

More formally, this is prompt tuning. Let an LLM be written as L L M ( X ) = F ( E ( X ) ) {\displaystyle LLM(X)=F(E(X))}, where X {\displaystyle X} is a sequence of linguistic tokens, E {\displaystyle E} is the token-to-vector function, and F {\displaystyle F} is the rest of the model. In prefix-tuning, one provides a set of input-output pairs { ( X i , Y i ) } i {\displaystyle \{(X^{i},Y^{i})\}_{i}}, and then use gradient descent to search for arg ⁡ max Z ~ ∑ i log ⁡ P r [ Y i | Z ~ ∗ E ( X i ) ] {\displaystyle \arg \max _{\tilde {Z}}\sum _{i}\log Pr[Y^{i}|{\tilde {Z}}\ast E(X^{i})]}. In words, log ⁡ P r [ Y i | Z ~ ∗ E ( X i ) ] {\displaystyle \log Pr[Y^{i}|{\tilde {Z}}\ast E(X^{i})]} is the log-likelihood of outputting Y i {\displaystyle Y^{i}}, if the model first encodes the input X i {\displaystyle X^{i}} into the vector E ( X i ) {\displaystyle E(X^{i})}, then prepend the vector with the "prefix vector" Z ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {Z}}}, then apply F {\displaystyle F}.

For prefix tuning, it is similar, but the "prefix vector" Z ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {Z}}} is pre-appended to the hidden states in every layer of the model.

An earlier result[59] uses the same idea of gradient descent search, but is designed for masked language models like BERT, and searches only over token sequences, rather than numerical vectors. Formally, it searches for arg ⁡ max X ~ ∑ i log ⁡ P r [ Y i | X ~ ∗ X i ] {\displaystyle \arg \max _{\tilde {X}}\sum _{i}\log Pr[Y^{i}|{\tilde {X}}\ast X^{i}]} where X ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {X}}} is ranges over token sequences of a specified length.
Prompt injection

See also: SQL injection and Cross-site scripting

Prompt injection is a family of related computer security exploits carried out by getting a machine learning model (such as an LLM) which was trained to follow human-given instructions to follow instructions provided by a malicious user. This stands in contrast to the intended operation of instruction-following systems, wherein the ML model is intended only to follow trusted instructions (prompts) provided by the ML model's operator.[60][61][62]

5 Easy Ways To Write Better ChatGPT Prompts

Here are 10 quick tips to write better prompts for ChatGPT:

    Customize your prompt
    Feed ChatGPT your facts and information
    Ask follow-up questions
    Be as specific as possible
    Write a long prompt paragraph

You know, just like engineering a Falcon rocket to land back on Earth, the magic with ChatGPT is all in the precision of your inputs. The more tailored your input, the more stellar the output. It’s like customizing a Tesla – the more you personalize, the better the ride.

Injecting specific details and data into ChatGPT is like giving the AI a blueprint. That's your ticket to outputs that feel like they're from 2040 - ahead of its time and top-tier, just like how the pros do it.

Instead of thinking of your prompts as mere sentences, imagine them as intricate blueprints or detailed roadmaps.

‍
For example:

    You are a blog writer with years of experience. Write a long and detailed blog post for bloggers who are learning how to write SEO-optimized blog posts. Create a catchy introduction, followed by these subsections (What Is an SEO-optimized Blog Post? How To Write an SEO-optimized blog post, and Avoid These Common Mistakes When Writing SEO Blog Posts). Finish with a short conclusion that includes a Call-to-Action to read other blog posts on my website.

ChatGPT can be a powerful tool and with constant updates learning to use it never stops. That's why I've created a 20,000+ advanced prompt collection to 10X your results with ChatGPT without putting any effort into it.

One of the first benefits I found when using Large Language Models (LLMs) was that they helped with the blank page problem. I could quickly go from a blog idea to a rough outline in just a few minutes.

While understanding the core principles of prompt engineering is still important, not using LLMs in the process of writing prompts just doesn’t make any sense.

In the same way that an LLM can help a writer overcome the blank page problem, it can also help prompt engineers establish a solid prompt structure.

This process of using LLMs to write prompts and using prompts to create other prompts is called meta prompting. Rather than crafting every detail of your prompt, you can use other prompts, systems, and LLMs to help expedite the process.

In this article, we’ll dive into how meta prompting works, breaking down some of the latest and most popular methods from recent research papers. We’ll cover plenty of examples so you can start using these techniques in your workflows and apps right away. Plus, you’ll be able to see how we’ve integrated meta prompting into PromptHub to make the prompt engineering process extremely efficient.

‍
What is Meta Prompting?

Meta prompting is a prompt engineering method that uses large language models (LLMs) to create and refine prompts.

Unlike traditional prompt engineering, where you write a prompt from scratch and hope for the best, meta prompting guides the LLM to adapt and adjust your prompt dynamically, based on your feedback, allowing it to handle more complex tasks and evolving contexts.

Now we’ll jump into a variety of the latest meta-prompting methods based on latest research.

‍

‍
PromptHub's Prompt Iterator

Many meta-prompting techniques involve a cycle: generating outputs, collecting user feedback, refining the prompt, and repeating the process.

Our new Prompt Enhancer, the Prompt Iterator automates this entire workflow, allowing you to submit feedback, run prompts, and let the LLM refine them for you. Feel free to try it out for free in PromptHub - it's available on all plans!

‍
Meta-Prompting

The first meta-prompting method we'll look at is simply called Meta-Prompting, developed through a collaboration from Stanford and OpenAI.

The core idea behind Meta-Prompting is to use an LLM as a conductor that can manage complex tasks by leveraging multiple independent LLMs that are experts in certain areas. This is similar to multi-persona prompting in that it is a collaboration between different LLMs with a lead conductor.
How It Works

    The central LLM receives a high-level “meta” prompt (copied below), that includes instructions to break down tasks into subtasks.
    Each subtask is assigned to an "expert" LLM with specific, detailed instructions
    The central LLM oversees communication between the expert LLMs, synthesizes their outputs, applies its own judgement, and generates a final output.

Pros

    Meta-Prompting is task-agnostic.
    The central model’s ability to coordinate multiple experts enhances problem-solving capabilities, which means more accurate and aligned results
    Doesn’t require a bank of test data

Cons

    Increased cost and latencies due to many LLM calls and interactions between the experts
    Requires some configuration and set up to handle the inter-model interactions
    Potential context window issues handling large message histories

‍
Meta Prompting prompt template

Here is the Meta prompting prompt template straight from the research paper:

‍
META PROMPT TEMPLATE
You are Meta-Expert, an extremely clever expert with the unique ability to collaborate with multiple experts (such as Expert Problem Solver, Expert Mathematician, Expert Essayist, etc.) to tackle any task and solve any complex problems. Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.

Note that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.

As Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.

To communicate with an expert, type its name (e.g., "Expert Linguist" or "Expert Puzzle Solver"), followed by a colon ":", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:

Expert Mathematician:
"""
You are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra. Compute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).
"""

Ensure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., "You are a physicist specialized in...").

Interact with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.

If you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.

Refrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.

Present the final answer as follows:
>> FINAL ANSWER:
"""
[final answer]
"""

For multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided information carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you come across multiple options.

‍

In this example, the Meta Model ('Meta-Expert') directs the task to an Expert Mathematician and provides a clear instruction. This instruction is isolated, allowing the expert to focus on their specific task. The Meta Model then verifies the response and integrates it into the overall solution.

Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP)

The next meta-prompting method we'll check out is from an Amazon paper called Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP): Automated Optimization and Adaption.
How It Works

    Starting with an initial prompt and a small training set containing input-output pairs, multiple prompt candidates are generated.
    The LLM generates outputs for each prompt candidate, which are then evaluated to identify where these candidates are succeeding and where they are falling short.
    LCP instructs the LLM to compare good prompts against bad ones, allowing the model to identify what is working and what isn’t.
    Based on this comparison, the LLM generates a new, refined prompt and continues to iteratively improve it.

Put briefly, the LLM is tasked with contrasting good prompts against bad ones, leveraging the comparison to refine prompts.
Pros

    LCP’s focus on contrasting both good and bad prompts can lead to a better optimization process and better final prompt variant
    LCP addresses the risk of overfitting by using multiple incorrect samples to create summaries of failure reasons, which enables the generation of a set of diverse prompt candidates
    This diversity enables exploration of the prompt space, preventing the model from getting trapped in a local minimum.
    LCP is also task agnostic

Cons

    High costs and latencies due to the need to generate, evaluate, and contrast multiple prompts in each iteration.
    The framework requires consistent feedback and evaluation to adapt effectively

LCP prompt template

Here are the LCP prompt templates straight from the research paper:
Reason Generation Prompt
Given input: {{ Input }}
And its expected output: {{ Onput }}
Explain the reason why the input corresponds to the given expected output. The reason should be placed within tag <reason></reason>.

‍
Summarization Prompt
Given input and expected output pairs, along with the reason for generated outputs, provide a summarized common reason applicable to all cases within tags <summary> and </summary>.
The summary should explain the underlying principles, logic, or methodology governing the relationship between the inputs and corresponding outputs. Avoid mentioning any specific details, numbers, or entities from the individual examples, and aim for a generalized explanation.

‍
High-level Contrastive Prompt
Given m examples of good prompts and their corresponding scores and m examples of bad prompts and their corresponding scores, explore the underlying pattern of good prompts, generate a new prompt based on this pattern. Put the new prompt within tag <prompt> and </prompt>.

Good prompts and scores:
Prompt 1:{{ PROMPT 1 }}
Score:{{ SCORE 1 }}
...
Prompt m: {{ PROMPT m }}
Score: {{ SCORE m }}

‍
Low-level Contrastive Prompts
Given m prompt pairs and their corresponding scores, explain why one prompt is better than others.

Prompt pairs and scores:

Prompt 1:{{ PROMPT 1 }} Score:{{ SCORE 1 }}
...

Prompt m:{{ PROMPT m }} Score:{{ SCORE m }}

Summarize these explanations and generate a new prompt accordingly. Put the new prompt within tag <prompt> and </prompt>.

‍

In this example, the LLM evaluates multiple prompt candidates, learning from both their strengths and weaknesses. By contrasting the best-performing prompts with less effective ones, the LLM iteratively generates an optimized prompt, adapting to changes in the model version or task requirements.

‍
Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE)

The next meta-prompting method comes from a paper out of the University of Waterloo called, Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers. Their meta-prompting method,  Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE), treats the prompt as a "program," optimizing it by searching over a pool of prompt candidates with the goal to maximize a specific score function.
How It Works

    Instruction Generation: An LLM generates a set of prompt candidates based on input-output demonstrations.
    Scoring and Evaluation: Each prompt is evaluated using a scoring function to measure its effectiveness.
    Iterative Search: The process iteratively uses a Monte Carlo search method, where LLMs refine the best prompts by proposing semantically similar prompt variants.

Generate a bunch of prompts, score and evaluate them, generate new semantically similar versions and select the prompt version with the highest score.

‍
prompt flow for automatic prompt engineering (APE)

‍
Pros

    APE’s experiment results consistently outperformed human-engineered prompts
    APE is adaptable and can optimize prompts for different scenarios (zero-shot, chain-of-thought, etc).
    APE is task agnostic

Cons

    The iterative search process can be computationally intensive
    Requires some dev work to spin up the system (the search process in particular)

Example Implementation using APE Templates

APE guides the LLM through generating, evaluating, and refining prompts in a structured, step-by-step process. Here's a quick example flow of how it works using the templates from the research paper:

‍
Step 1: Instruction generation
I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.

Here are the input-output pairs:
Input: [ ] Output: [ ]
Input: [ ] Output: [ ]

The instruction was...

‍

In this first step, APE generates an initial instruction that could have led to the provided input-output pairs, setting up the foundation for the prompt.

‍
Step 2: Zero-Shot Evaluation
Instruction: {{ step1.output}}

Input: [ ]
Output: <COMPLETE>

‍

At this stage, the LLM evaluates how effectively the generated instruction from Step 1 performs when given new inputs. This helps identify how well the prompt works without any additional examples.

‍
Step 3: Iterative Refinement
Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.

Feedback: {{ step2.output}}
Input: {{ step1.output}}
Output:

‍‍

Using the feedback from Step 2, the LLM refines the initial instruction, creating a new version that aims to be more effective based on the evaluation.

‍
Step 4: Reverse Generation
I instructed my friend to {{ step3.output}} . The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.

Here are the input-output pairs:
Input: [ ] Output: [ ]
Input: [ ] Output: [ ]
...

‍

This step helps APE further understand how the refined instruction maps to the given input-output pairs, ensuring that the prompt remains accurate and adaptable.

‍
Step 5: Zero-shot-CoT (Chain of Thought) Incorporation
Instruction: Answer the following question.

Q: [INPUT]
A: {{ step4.output}}

‍

Finally, the LLM incorporates a Chain of Thought reasoning into the prompt, enhancing its ability to handle more complex tasks in a zero-shot setting.

‍

Summing it up:

    The LLM generates multiple instruction candidates based on initial input-output pairs.
    These candidates are scored based on their effectiveness.
    Through an iterative process, the LLM generates improved candidates, refining the instruction to achieve optimal performance.

‍
PromptAgent

Next up is a meta-prompting method we'll check out is called PromptAgent. PromptAgent views the prompt generation and optimization process as a planning problem and really tries to focus on leverage expert/SME knowledge in the prompt engineering process.
How It Works

    The process starts with an initial prompt and a target task.
    Outputs are generated and evaluated
    PromptAgent integrates expert-level knowledge in the feedback loops
    PromptAgent iteratively refines the prompt based on the feedback, growing the prompt space in a tree structure and prioritizing high-reward paths

‍
Example flow of PromptAgent

‍
Pros

    PromptAgent’s major differentiator is its focus on mimicking subject matter experts in the prompt engineering process, using expert-like feedback and insights to iteratively refine and optimize prompts.
    PromptAgent uses some prompt engineering to focus on leveraging expert-level knowledge
    The method effectively uses self-reflection and error feedback to achieve a higher level of precision and adaptability.
    AgentPrompt is task agnostic

Cons

    Implementing AgentPrompt in full requires setting up a tree like reasoning structure, which may be complicated and lead to higher costs

‍

‍
Example Implementation with PromptAgent

Here are the four core prompt templates directly from the PromptAgent.

input_format

{{task-prefix}}
{{question}}
{{task-suffix}}
{{answer-format}}

‍
error_string
<<{index}>>
The model’s input is:
{{question}}
The model’s response is:
{{output}
The correct label is: {{labl}}
The model’s prediction is {{prediction}}

‍
error_feedback
I’m writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.
My current prompt is:
{{cur_prompt}}
But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
{{error_string}}

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

‍
state_transit
I’m writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.
My current prompt is:
{{cur_prompt}}
But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
{{error_string}}

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
{{error_feedback}}

There is a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
{{trajectory_prompts}}

Based on the above information, please write {{steps_per_gradient}} new prompts following these guidelines:
1. The new prompts should solve the current prompt’s problems.
2. The new prompts should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. Each new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts are:

‍
Conversational Prompt Engineering (CPE)

I’m a huge fan of this next meta-prompting method. Conversational Prompt Engineering (CPE) is a simple chat-interface that guides users in creating and refining prompts through an interactive conversation.
How It Works

    First up, the user selects which model it wants to use (the “target model) and uploads a file with some input examples. For example, if the task is summarizing articles, the file could contain several full-length articles.
    The user and CPE go back in forth via a chat, asking relevant data-driven questions about output preferences. This interaction helps shape an initial prompt.
    Based on user feedback, CPE refines the initial prompt, and incorporates relevant details
    A prompt is created and is sent to a different model (”target” model) to generate outputs
    The user reviews the outputs and provides feedback some more feedback, adjustments are made as necessary
    Once all prompt outputs are approved, CPE generates a final few-shot prompt that includes examples approved by the user.

‍
CPE conversation flow

‍
Pros

    CPE makes it easy for users to generate personalized, high-quality prompts without needing labeled data or pre-existing prompts
    The simple setup of a chat interface makes it extremely user friendly and leads to better outputs based on feedback and quick iterations
    CPE is task agnostic

Cons

    The iterative nature of CPE might be time-consuming, as it requires multiple rounds of user feedback to refine the prompts fully.
    Potential memory issues

‍

‍
An example of CPE in action
An example dialogue flow for CPE
Example Implementation

The following templates demonstrates how CPE operates:

‍
Initialization: You and I (system) will work together to build a prompt for the task of the user via a chat with the user. This prompt will be fed to a model dedicated to performing the user’s task. Our aim is to build a prompt that when fed to the model, produces outputs that are aligned with the user’s expectations. Thus, the prompt should reflect the specific requirements and preferences of the user from the output as expressed in the chat. You will interact with the user to gather information regarding their preferences and needs. I will send the prompts you suggest to the dedicated model to generate outputs, and pass them back to you, so that you could discuss them with the user and get feedback.

User time is valuable, keep the conversation pragmatic. Make the obvious decisions by your Don’t greet the user at your first interaction. You should communicate with the user and system ONLY via python API described below, and not via direct messages. The input parameters to API functions should be string literals using double quotes. Remember to escape double-quote characters inside the parameter values. Note that the user is not aware of the API, so don’t tell the user which API you are going to call. Format ALL your answers with python code calling one of the following functions:

‍
API instructions:
function submit_message_to_user(msg): call this function to submit your message to the user. Use markdown to mark the prompts and the outputs.
function submit_prompt(prompt): call this function to inform the system that you have a new suggestion for the prompt. Use it only with the prompts approved by the user.
function switch_to_example(example_num): call this function before you start discussing with the user an output of a specific example, and pass the example number as parameter.
function show_original_text(example_num): call this function when the user asks to show the original text of an example, and pass the example number as parameter.
function output_accepted(example_num, output): call this function every time the user unequivocally accepts an output. Pass the example number and the output text as parameters.
function end_outputs_discussion(): call this function after all the outputs have been discussed with the user and all 3 outputs were accepted by the user.
function conversation_end(): call this function when the user wants to end the conversation.

‍
User data intro: The user has provided some text examples. I’ve selected a few of them that you will use in the conversation. Note that your goal to build a generic prompt, and not for these specific examples.

User data analysis: Before suggesting the prompt, briefly discuss the text examples with the user and ask them relevant questions regarding their output requirements and preferences. Please take into account the specific character user’s expectations from the task output as expressed during the chat. Share the suggested prompt with the user before submitting it. Remember to communicate only via API calls.

‍
Outputs intro: Based on the suggested prompt, the model has produced the following outputs for the user input examples:

Outputs analysis: For each of 3 examples show the model output to the user and discuss it with them, one example at a time. Use switch_example API to navigate between examples. The discussion should take as long as necessary and result in an output accepted by the user in a clear way, with no doubts, conditions, or modifications. When the output is accepted, call output_accepted API passing the example number and the output text. After calling output_accepted call either switch_to_example API to move to the next example, or end_outputs_discussion API if all 3 have been accepted. Assume that the user comments relay to the output only. Only when the user explicitly says that he wants to update the prompt and not the output, show the updated prompt to them. Remember to communicate only via API calls.

Example switch: You have switched modes. Look at the user comments and the accepted outputs for the previous examples, apply them to the model output of this example, and present the result to the user. Indicate the example (number), and format the text so that the output and your text are separated by empty lines. Discuss the presented output taking into account the system conclusion for this example if exists.

‍
Outputs CoT start: In the following discussion, the user was asked to give feedback on the model’s outputs that were generated by the prompt {{PROMPT}} . The outputs that did not meet the user’s requirements were modified.

‍
Outputs CoT end: Analyze the conversation above, and share the comments made by the user on Examples 1-3. Any comment should be shared, even if minor. If no comment has been made, accept the prompt. If any comment has been made, recommend how to improve the prompt so it would produce the accepted outputs directly.

‍
Outputs discussion: Continue your conversation with the user. Do the recommendations above suggest improvements to the prompt? If so, present the modified prompt to the user, and submit it only after the user approves it. Otherwise, if no modifications to the prompt are required, communicate it to the user and suggest to finish the conversation.

‍
Conversation end: This is the end of the conversation. Say goodbye to the user, and inform them that the final prompt that includes few-shot examples and is formatted for the <model> can be downloaded via the **Download few shot prompt** button below. Also, kindly refer the user to the survey tab that is now available, and let the user know that we will appreciate any feedback.

‍

‍
DSPy

The next meta-prompting method we'll examine is very popular framework called DSPy (Pronounced Dee-Ess-Pie). DSPy enables technical users to create, optimize, and manage complex pipelines of LLM calls in a structured, programmatic manner.

DSPy treats LLMs as modular components in a programming model, enabling users to combine, refine, and enhance their interactions over time.
How It Works

    Users define DSPy modules with specific tasks, like creative writing or sentiment analysis. Each module has a defined signature that outlines the input and expected output.
    DSPy constructs a sequence of LLM calls, allowing for step-by-step processing and optimization.
    DSPy iteratively refines the output by utilizing modules like ChainOfThought to guide the LLM's reasoning process. It collects data from user feedback and uses scoring mechanisms to identify and prioritize high-quality outputs.
    Teleprompter modules evaluate the LLM's performance on generated outputs, refining prompts based on scoring metrics and improving the overall quality through adaptive feedback.

‍

LLMs serve multiple roles within DSPy, from generating the initial prompts, to generating evaluating outputs, refining prompts, and learning from user interactions. This adaptive, and code-first, framework allows the LLM to evolve and improve its performance over time.
Pros

    DSPy allows for creating complex, multi-step prompt workflows that adapt based on user input and feedback, making it highly versatile.
    The system learns and improves over time, becoming more efficient at generating accurate and high-quality outputs.
    The integration of modules like ChainOfThought and teleprompters enables more structured, logic-driven prompt generation and evaluation.
    DSPy’s ability to manage multiple LLM calls allows it to refine prompts through self-improving feedback loops, enhancing output quality over successive iterations.
    DSPy is task agnostic

Cons

    DSPy can be quite complex to set up and requires technical knowledge
    Managing large pipelines with iterative evaluations can become challenging

‍
Example implementation

We’ll run through an example use case of content generation to see how DSPy works. Specifically lets say a user wants to create a blog post about "AI Trends 2024":

‍
Step 1: Initialization

The user initializes a DSPy module to generate blog content.

content_generator = dspy.Predict("topic -> blog_content")

Step 2: Initial Content Setup

The user provides the topic.

content_generator(topic="AI Trends 2024")
‍
Step 3: Initial Content Generation

The LLM generates the following content:

"AI Trends 2024: In the coming year, AI is expected to advance in natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. There will be greater adoption of AI in finance and retail sectors..."
‍
Step 4: User Review and Feedback

The user reviews the generated content and provides feedback.

Feedback: "Include more examples of AI applications in healthcare."

‍
Step 5: LLM-Guided Prompt Optimization based on user feedback
"Provide a detailed overview of AI trends in 2024, focusing on natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. Include specific examples, such as AI-driven diagnostics and robotic surgery in healthcare."
‍

The revised content:

"In 2024, AI will greatly impact healthcare, with AI-driven diagnostics enabling faster, more accurate medical assessments. Robotic surgery, guided by AI algorithms, will improve precision..."

Step 6: Scoring and Evaluation by Teleprompter

DSPy uses another LLM to score the content based on criteria like specificity, coherence, and completeness.

    Evaluation Score: 8/10
    Feedback: "The content is clear and covers examples well, but could benefit from a conclusion summarizing the key trends."

‍
Step 7: The LLM makes final adjustments based on previous feedback to include a summary
"...Include a final section summarizing the main AI trends for 2024 and their potential impact on various industries."
‍

Final output:

"In summary, AI trends in 2024 will span across natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare, revolutionizing how we interact with technology and improving outcomes across industries..."

End-to-End Process Recap:

    User Inputs: Initial topic, feedback for improvement.
    LLM Calls:
        Generated initial content based on the topic.
        Adapted prompts based on user feedback.
        Scored and provided evaluations to optimize the prompt.
        Finalized content with concluding elements.

DSPy is a little complicated but is also a very powerful way to leverage LLMs to generate, evaluate, and refine prompts through user interaction and automation.

‍
TEXTGRAD: Textual Gradient-Based Optimization

The next and final meta-prompting method we'll explore is TEXTGRAD. In many ways, TEXTGRAD can be seen as a successor to DSPy, drawing inspiration from its approach while building upon it to make it even better.

The main differentiator that TEXTGRAD introduces is its emphasis on using natural language feedback as "textual gradients." This allows the model to iteratively refine prompts based on detailed, human-like suggestions, leading to more nuanced and accurate outputs over successive iterations.
How It Works

    It all starts with a base version of the prompt
    A second LLM or (human) reviews and evaluates the output and provides detailed natural language feedback. This feedback serves as the "textual gradient," highlighting areas for improvement.
    The original prompt and feedback are then sent to another LLM to generate an improved version of the prompt. This iterative process repeats until the prompt’s output meets the desired criteria.

In TEXTGRAD an LLM is used as both a generator and evaluator. The feedback from one model is used to help another refine the prompt in an iterative fashion.
Pros

    TEXTGRAD uses natural language feedback to refine outputs, which makes it very flexible
    Since TEXTGRAD focuses on natural language feedback, it allows for more nuanced and specific changes compared to more rigid, numerical optimization techniques
    TEXTGRAD is task agnostic, but really shines on tasks that require detail feedback like creative writing

Cons

    The iterative nature of TEXTGRAD makes it time-consuming and potentially expensive

Example Implementation

To show how TEXTGRAD operates, let's run through an example where a user wants to generate a blog post about "AI Trends in 2024":

‍
1.Initial Content Generation Prompt:
Write a blog post based on this topic: {{topic}}

‍

‍
2. Feedback Collection:
Evaluate the following blog post for relevance, engagement, coherence, and clarity: {{step1.output}} . Provide feedback on how to improve the introduction, add more engaging content, and ensure the information is well-researched and accurate.

‍

The feedback might be:‍
"The introduction could be more engaging by starting with a surprising statistic or question. Include more specific examples, such as AI-driven diagnostics in healthcare and autonomous driving advancements."

3. Generating a New Optimized Prompt Based on Feedback:
Based on the feedback provided, revise the following prompt to improve its effectiveness. The feedback highlights areas that need enhancement, such as engagement, clarity, and content quality. Make sure to incorporate these suggestions into the revised prompt.

Original Prompt: 'Write a blog post based on this topic: {{topic}} '
Feedback:n{{feedback}}

Please provide a new, optimized prompt that addresses the feedback while retaining the original intent of the prompt.

Prompt generator tools

Prompt generators are an easy way to leverage meta prompting with minimal work. Fortunately, there are several platforms that streamline the whole process.
PromptHub’s Prompt Generator

Our new prompt generator tool brings together all the insights and techniques we've shared on our blog, packaging them into a free tool that you can use to create high-quality prompts.

‍

Here's what our prompt generator offers:

    Tailored prompts: Adjusts prompts based on the model provider you're using, because one size doesn’t fit all.
    Best practices built-in: Leverages prompt engineering best practices—just describe your task, and the tool handles the rest.
    Completely free: Yes, you heard that right—our prompt generator is free!

Anthropic's Prompt Generator

Anthropic stands out as one of the leading companies in prompt engineering, and their prompt generator is a fantastic tool, especially if you frequently work within their development console. Optimized for Anthropic-specific prompts, their generator is both fast and an excellent starting point for creating effective prompts.

OpenAI's Prompt Generator

At OpenAI's most recent Dev Day, they launched a new feature that specifically generates system instruction prompts based on a task description However, it's worth noting that this feature isn't available for the o1 models, as they currently don't support system message role types.

Conclusion

Meta prompting and using prompt generators can be a great place to start when working on a prompt. While they aren’t a complete replacement for understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of LLMs or prompt engineering best practices, but we highly recommend using them.

We touched on a variety of different meta-prompting methods and different prompt generators throughout this post. Implementing any of these frameworks will enhance your prompt's performance; it’s just a matter of finding the one that makes the most sense for your needs.

We're excited to see how you leverage our prompt generator, and we look forward to continuing to develop new prompt optimization tools that will make meta prompting more accessible for everyone.

    Create a menu from a fictitious restaurant. Make sure the restaurant has a theme, such as Classic Books, and the food should all be given appropriate names (e.g., “Mockingbird Pie”).

---

🚦DIAGNÓSTICO DE CUELLOS DE BOTELLA

Según tu perfil y contexto habitual de trabajo en una pequeña empresa sin soporte técnico, estos suelen ser los principales problemas:

1. Gestión manual de información: copiar/pegar datos entre correos, Excel, agendas, formularios.


2. Falta de visibilidad del flujo de trabajo: tareas sueltas, sin una visión clara de prioridades o vencimientos.


3. Tareas repetitivas no estandarizadas: escribir correos similares a diario, programar citas, actualizar hojas de cálculo.


4. Baja automatización de comunicaciones internas o con clientes: seguimiento de correos, recordatorios, envíos de documentos.


5. Desconocimiento de herramientas no-code que podrías usar de forma sencilla para aligerar tu carga.

🛠️ RECOMENDACIONES DE HERRAMIENTAS Y USOS ESPECÍFICOS

Tarea	Herramienta recomendada	Automatización propuesta

Pasar datos de formularios o correos a hojas de Excel o Google Sheets	Make o n8n	Extrae datos de emails o formularios (Google Forms) y guárdalos automáticamente.
Recordatorios automáticos para citas o tareas	Google Calendar + IFTTT o Zapier	Crea recordatorios o eventos con alertas según condiciones predefinidas.
Enviar correos automáticos personalizados	Gmail + Make o Zapier	Plantillas de email que se activan según respuestas o formularios.
Organizar tareas diarias en un panel visual	Trello o Notion	Kanban con fechas, etiquetas y automatizaciones simples.
Seguimiento de clientes	Google Sheets + Slack/Email vía Make	Notifica automáticamente cuando cambia el estado de un cliente o se acerca una fecha clave.
Crear reportes automáticos	Google Sheets + Google Docs	Usa plantillas con variables que se llenan automáticamente cada semana.



---

🪜 PLAN DE ACCIÓN PASO A PASO (sin saber programar)

🔹 PASO 1: Diagnóstico Express

Haz una lista de las 5 tareas que más repites cada semana (ej: responder correos de cotizaciones, ingresar datos de clientes en Excel…).

Para cada una, pregúntate: ¿necesita intervención humana o solo mover datos de un lugar a otro?


🔹 PASO 2: Selección de herramienta

Usa esta mini guía:

Si quieres automatizar cosas entre apps → Usa Make (más visual que Zapier) o IFTTT (más simple).

Si necesitas organizarte visualmente → Trello o Notion.

Si quieres algo muy potente y personalizable a futuro → n8n (requiere un poco más de curva de aprendizaje, ideal a mediano plazo).



🔹 PASO 3: Primera automatización en Make

Ejemplo: Automatizar guardar respuestas de Google Forms en Google Sheets y enviar un email de confirmación.

1. Ve a Make.com


2. Crea un escenario nuevo.


3. Añade:

Módulo 1: Google Forms (escucha nuevas respuestas)

Módulo 2: Google Sheets (añade una nueva fila)

Módulo 3: Gmail (envía email al cliente con una plantilla predefinida)




✅ Sin código, solo configurando con clics.

🔹 PASO 4: Organización visual

Crea un tablero en Trello o Notion con 3 columnas: “Pendiente”, “En proceso”, “Completado”.

Usa IFTTT o Make para mover tarjetas automáticamente si cambian ciertas condiciones (por ejemplo, si se acerca la fecha límite o si alguien responde un formulario).


🔹 PASO 5: Itera y mejora

Cada semana: anota qué automatización funcionó y qué más podrías quitar de encima.

Usa plantillas prehechas (Make, IFTTT y Zapier tienen cientos) para cosas como:

Gestión de facturas

Seguimiento de pagos

Envío de reportes semanales




---

📌 EJEMPLO CONCRETO

Tarea actual: “Copio manualmente datos de clientes que me llegan por email a un Excel.”

✅ Solución sin código:

Crea una etiqueta en Gmail: “ClienteNuevo”.

En Make:

1. Activa un trigger cuando llegue un email nuevo con esa etiqueta.


2. Extrae nombre, teléfono y email.


3. Añade una fila a tu hoja de Google Sheets.


4. Envía un correo automático de bienvenida al cliente.





---

💡 SUGERENCIAS FINALES

Crea una rutina semanal de revisión de automatizaciones: ¿qué me sigue quitando tiempo?

Usa recursos como Toolify, Futurepedia, o There’s an AI for That para descubrir nuevas herramientas.

No empieces con n8n hasta que domines Make: n8n es más potente pero requiere un poco de lógica más técnica.

### **10 Prompts para la Memoria de ChatGPT:**

1. **Claro y directo**:
   Habla siempre con honestidad, sin halagos ni cumplidos innecesarios. Desafíame cuando esté equivocado o inseguro; prefiero corrección en lugar de consuelo. Sé directo y franco en tus respuestas.

2. **Vende Motos OFF**:
   Si no sabes la respuesta a algo, di claramente 'No lo sé' en lugar de inventar o divagar.

3. **Al grano**:
   Responde de forma directa y técnica. Elimina todo tipo de expresiones sociales, saludos, disculpas, emojis o adornos. Entrega solo la información solicitada, sin explicaciones innecesarias, y asume que tengo conocimientos avanzados.

4. **Anti Saturación**:
   Siempre que me expliques un proceso paso a paso, entrégame solo un paso por mensaje y no avances al siguiente hasta que yo lo solicite explícitamente.

5. **Coach Pro**:
   Actúa como un coach emocional profesional. Hazme preguntas para identificar los bloqueos que me impiden avanzar en mi vida personal. No me des respuestas rápidas; en lugar de eso, ayúdame a reflexionar.

---

### **6) Revisión Pro**:

Cuando yo escriba “revísalo” (o frases equivalentes como “mejora esto”, “corrígelo”, etc.) debes hacer lo siguiente, sin saltarte ningún punto:

1. Detente y relee tu última respuesta completa.
2. Evalúala críticamente en silencio (no muestres esta reflexión); verifica exactitud, profundidad, claridad, tono, brevedad, estructura lógica, ejemplos, fuentes y posibles omisiones.
3. Enumera internamente los fallos o áreas de mejora y diseña un plan concreto para corregirlos.
4. Genera una nueva versión significativamente mejorada que:
   • Corrija los errores detectados.
   • Aporte detalles adicionales útiles (pero evita verborrea).
   • Mantenga un lenguaje claro, ordenado y adaptado al contexto.
   • Incluya ejemplos, pasos, tablas o citas solo si realmente aportan valor.
5. Entrega únicamente la versión revisada, precedida por un breve encabezado: “Versión revisada:”.
6. Espera mi aprobación. No avances con más contenido ni cierres el tema hasta que yo confirme que la respuesta es satisfactoria.

---

7. **Detector de Hype**:
   Cuando notes que me entusiasmo con una nueva tecnología o tendencia, señálame de inmediato la evidencia objetiva (costes, barreras, tracción real) y pregúntame métricas concretas para justificar la emoción.

8. **Foco**:
   Si menciono un proyecto nuevo, hazme aclarar: Por qué, para quién, cómo y cuándo; luego exige qué voy a dejar de hacer para liberar recursos.

9. **Riesgo Ignorado**:
   Si detectas puntos ciegos (regulación, competencia dura, costes ocultos), resáltalos en un bloque al final de tu respuesta.

10. **Ejemplo Obligatorio**:
    Siempre que expliques un concepto, acompáñalo con un ejemplo concreto aplicado a mi negocio.
